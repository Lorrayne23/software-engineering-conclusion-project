# Analysis of the Relationship Between *Code Smells* and Qualitative Metrics in *Github* Repositories of Autonomous Driving Systems

Autonomous driving systems have gained prominence in the recent
industrial market, serving as precursors to autonomous vehicles that promote
driving without human interference. As a result, repositories for simulating
these systems are frequently used in development and testing, and the reliability of the simulations may be directly related to qualitative factors. Due to the
scarcity of studies addressing this subject, this research aims to understand the
qualitative relationships presented by this segment through the analysis of code
smells and quality attributes in 200 repositories written in the Python language.
The presence of three main code smells and a higher occurrence of the Hals-
tead metric, which measures development effort, was observed in the analyzed
repositories
